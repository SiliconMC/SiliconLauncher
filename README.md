# SiliconLauncher

**Also known as the Silicon launcher.**

The Silicon launcher is currently in a public testing phase. We wanted to release a version of the launcher that is fully functional aside from launching the game (and related settings). **If you would like to help out, click [here](https://github.com/SiliconMC/SiliconLauncher/releases/)**.
