# SiliconLauncher
**Also known as the Silicon launcher.**
 
The Silicon launcher is currently in a public testing phase. We wanted to release a version of the launcher that is fully functional aside from launching the game (and related settings). **If you would like to help out, click [here](https://github.com/SiliconMC/SiliconLauncher/releases/tag/v1.0.0-pb)**.
